# ProGuard - Password Strength Tester

## Overview

ProGuard is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool that helps users test the strength of their passwords and generate secure, random passwords. The app uses simple but effective algorithms to evaluate password strength based on criteria like length, character variety, and complexity. It also offers real-time feedback, security suggestions for weak passwords, and a password generator feature.

## Features

- **Password Strength Tester**: Check password strength based on length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- **Password Generator**: Generate strong passwords with a customizable length.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Show or hide the entered password for convenience.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Copy generated passwords to the clipboard for easy use.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Get suggestions for improving weak passwords.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Tkinter is included by default with Python, so no additional installation is needed)

## Features Details

### Password Strength Evaluation
The password strength is evaluated based on the following criteria:
- **Length**: The password should be at least 8 characters long. Stronger passwords are longer.
- **Character Variety**: It checks if the password contains:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)
  
### Password Generator
The generator creates a password by randomly picking characters from a pool of:
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters

The default length is 12 characters, but you can adjust the length using the length slider.
